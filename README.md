# Slint Rust Template

A template for a Rust application that's using [Slint](https://slint.rs) for the user interface.

## About

This template helps you get started developing a Rust application with Slint as toolkit
for the user interface. It demonstrates the integration between the `.slint` UI markup and
Rust code, how to trigger react to callbacks, get and set properties and use basic widgets.

## Usage

1. Install Rust by following the [Rust Getting Started Guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).
   Once this is done, you should have the ```rustc``` compiler and the ```cargo``` build system installed in your path.
2. Install [`cargo-generate`](https://github.com/cargo-generate/cargo-generate)  
3. Build with cargo
    ```
    cargo build
    ```
4. Run the application binary
     ```
     cargo run
     ```
